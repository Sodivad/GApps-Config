#.gapps-config
My .gapps-config for [OpenGApps](http://github.com/opengapps/opengapps) I'm using with CM 12.1. It exludes apps that are already in CM or very similar to the 
Google variant (Keyboard, Clock, Messenger, ...) or I just don't use (Fit) and retains the stock apps while still
installing the Google apps (Trebuchet and Now Launcher, Email and GMail, Stock-Gallery and Photos, ...).
